**Practical classes**

The directory structure presents a folder for each class (labX, X being the class number), where you can find the solved exercises and some notes that I have taken. The exercises for each class are described in [TQS-202021 Weekly labs.pdf](TQS-202021 Weekly labs.pdf).

**Midterm assignment**

You can also find [homework](homework) folder, in which there is the code implementation of a Spring Boot app for Meteorology and UV index alerts, developed focused on the usage of the multiple testing tools that we have learned by the middle of the semester.
